# Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Dart code: insufficient exception handling in an asynchronous operation. The `bug.dart` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.dart` presents an improved version with more robust error handling.

## Problem

The original code uses a `catch` block that simply prints the error message.  This is inadequate for production-ready applications.  The application may crash, or more subtly, enter an unexpected state.  Proper error handling needs to consider user experience and application resilience.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates better error handling by:

- Providing more context in the error message.
- Considering alternative approaches, such as retrying the API call after a delay, providing feedback to the user, or gracefully degrading functionality.

This example focuses on improving the error handling by providing better information to the developer for debugging and improving user experience.
